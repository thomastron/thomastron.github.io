# PlaneSections
<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/img/Beam Image.png" width="500">
</p>

A lightweight finite element beam bending library built on [OpenSeesPy](https://github.com/zhuminjie/OpenSeesPy).


**NOTE:**
Units for force and length must be applied to the beam in a [consistent unit base for FEM](https://femci.gsfc.nasa.gov/units/index.html).
PlaneSections has been design with Metric units in mind in terms of scaling diagrams. For those using imperial units, results will work with a consitent unit basis, but the scale of the digrams may be off.

## Demo

## Further Examples
See the examples folder for more examples!

## License:
Some restrictions exist for OpenSees license, so this for now this libary is restricted for resale. 
Basically, you are able to use the software for anything except commercial use external.

What you can do:
- Use PlaneSections commercially to analyze/design beams on your building.
- Develop an App that uses PlaneSections to analyze beams, and share that app within your comapny.

What you can't do:
- Use PlaneSections to develop an App, then sell that app externally to your company.


## Status
The next development steps are to:
- [] Add labels to diagrams.
- [] Finsih the readthedocs website.
